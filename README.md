# Understanding Word-Auto-Correct with C++ Program
## Word Auto-Correct:
Autocorrect is a word processing feature that identifies misspelled words, and uses algorithms to identify the words most likely to have been intended, and edits the text accordingly. This feature is used widely in modern applications like Microsoft Word, Gmail, Google Search Engine and many more.
## What To Learn:
With this project, we will learn how to implement such an algorithm using Trie Data Structure and other relevant concepts of C++.

[Trie Data Structure](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/)
## About This Project:
[dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt) contains 300 of the most used words of the English dictionary and is stored in a Trie Data Structure. It is an analogy to a full size dictionary of all words of the English language used in bigger programs. A word is taken as input from the user and if it is mis-spelled, most relevant words are displayed using the Trie.
## Pre-Requisite:
* Understanding Of Basics Of C++ Including OOP and STL
* Trie Data Structure
* Text File Handling
## Note:
To run this program correctly, make sure dictionary.txt is present in the directory where you will save your cpp file.
